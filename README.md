# Disclaimers
Please note that any PowerShell commands provided are to be used at your own risk and discretion. Running scripts comes with inherent risks. While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, improper use of these commands can result in unintended consequences, including system instability or data loss. It is recommended to back up important data and create a system restore point before executing any PowerShell commands. Prior to deploying scripts in a live environment, consider testing with virtual machines. If you are unsure about any command or its potential impact, please seek assistance from a qualified IT professional.
